1. Understanding how to create and access elements in a list. 

    createing list : for that we have to define in squre "[ ]" brackets
        ex : list = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
             numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

    accessing list : we can eccess the list by indexing
                     we can eccess by slicing also 


2. Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing). 

    accessing list :
    
        eccess the list by indexing
            ex : list = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
                 print(list[0])
                 print(list[-1])




3. Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.

        eccess by slicing : 

            ex : list = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
                 numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
                 print(list[:2])
                 print(list[1:])
                 print(number[1:5:2])
                 print(number[-1::-1])
