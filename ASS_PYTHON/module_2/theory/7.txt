1. Iterating over a dictionary using loops. 
    for keys :  student={"name":"rudra", "age":"20", "cource":"python"}
                for i in student:
                    print(i)

    for values: student={"name":"rudra", "age":"20", "cource":"python"}
                for i in student.values():
                    print(i)

    for both : student={"name":"rudra", "age":"20", "cource":"python"}
                for i in student.items():
                    print(i)

2. Merging two lists into a dictionary using loops or zip(). 

    keys = ["name", "age", "cource"]
    values = ["rudra", "20", "python"]
    student={}
    for i in range(len(keys)):
        student[keys[i]]=values[i]
    print(student)


3. Counting occurrences of characters in a string using dictionaries.
