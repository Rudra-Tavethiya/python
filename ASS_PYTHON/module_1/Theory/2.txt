1. Understanding Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines.
    indentation : 4 space


2. Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.
    indentation : here we have to use 4 space insted of tab
    comments : comments are define by #
    naming : in python we can not use keyword name as variable name and variable name can not start with number 
             we can use numbers and _ in variable name


3. Writing readable and maintainable code.
    code :  a=10
            b=20
            sum=a+b
            print(sum)
