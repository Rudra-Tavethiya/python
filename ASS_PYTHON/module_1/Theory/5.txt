1. Introduction to for and while loops. 

    for loop : when we know the how many times we have to run the loop at that time we have to use for loop
        example : we have to print 1 to 5 numbers
            code : for i in range(1,6):
                        print(i)

    while : when we have to run the loop till the condition is not satisfied at that time we have to
            use while loop
        example : we have to print 1 to 5 number 
            code : i=1
                   while i<=5:
                    print(i)


2. Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.). 

    list=["apple","banana","cherry"]
    for i in list:
        print(i)

    tpl=("apple","banana","cherry")
    for i in tpl:
        print(i)
